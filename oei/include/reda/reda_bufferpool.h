 *
 * The REDA BufferPool interface defines an API manage a fixed number of
 * fixed sized elements. It is important to note that the number of elements
 * in the pool cannot grow beyond what was specified when the pool was created.
 * Callbacks can be installed to be notified when the buffer pool allocates
 * a new buffer or free a buffer.
